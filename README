GEBEN-0.10
----------

GEBEN is a PHP source code level debugger running under Emacs.

GEBEN is alpha stage in this release. Only a few features are covered.
(Still it might be useful with help of Emacs' other features ;-)


BIG CHANGES
-----------

- From this release GEBEN does not depend on CEDET emacs library.
  If you have installed CEDET previously only for GEBEN-pre-alpha, you
  can uninstall CEDET if you want.
- Now GEBEN lisp package forms a monolithic file.
  If you have installed previous version, you should remove all of old
  GEBEN files from instllation directory.

FEATURES
--------

- some kind of code execution
   run/stop/step-in/step-over/step-out
- set/unset line-number breakpoints
- expression evaluation


REQUIREMENTS
------------

[server side]
 - linux box (currently not working on Windows box)
 - Web server with PHP engine
 - `Xdebug' PHP extention 2.0.3 or later, configured as
  remote debugging enabled with DBGp protocol

[client side]
 - Emacs21.4 or later
 - xdebugclient


INSTALLATION
------------

[server side]

1. Install a web server. (Apache2, etc.)
2. Install php. (http://php.net)
3. Install Xdebug. (http://xdebug.org)
4. Confugure php INI file as following:
    (requires)
    - xdebug.remote_enable = true
    - xdebug.remote_handler = dbgp
    - xdebug.remote_host = your_client_ip_or_hostname
    (optional)
    - xdebug.remote_autostart = On
5. Run the web server

[client side]

1. Download a xdebugclient program (http://xdebug.org/)
   and locate it to /usr/local/bin or somewhere where PATH is
   enabled.
1' Or build manually from source code. Sources are included in
   Xdebug source code package.
2. Unpack geben source code package and copy geben.el into
   somewhere Emacs' variable `load-path' holds.
   (e.g. /usr/share/Emacs/site-lisp/)
3. Insert autoload hooks into your .Emacs file.
    -> (autoload 'geben "geben" "PHP Debugger on Emacs" t)


DEBUGGING
---------

Here is an illustration.

1. Run Emacs.
2. Start geben: M-x geben
3. Access to debuggee server's php web page via browser or
   something like that web client program.
   If the server's xdebug configuration parameter
   `xdebug.remote_autostart' is not "On", you need to add an 
   additional query parameter `XDEBUG_SESSION_START' to start
   an xdebug debugging session.
   e.g.)
     http://www.example.com/test.php?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1
4. When the xdebug session connection is established there
   appears a source code of the page on the Emacs' buffer.
5. Now the buffer is under the minor-mode 'geben-mode'.
   You can controll the debugger with several keys.

     spc step into/step over
     i   step into
     o   step over
     r   step out
     b   set a breakpoint at a line
     u   unset a breakpoint at a line
     g   run
     q   stop
